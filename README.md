## 📖 About Us

Muganagish (מוגנגיש) is a comprehensive platform designed to help people with disabilities find accessible shelters and protected spaces during emergencies in Israel. The system allows for the documentation and search of shelters with accessibility features, enabling the sharing of reliable and accurate information about shelters and their accessibility details.

As part of the "Code for Israel" community, Muganagish is dedicated to improving accessibility to shelters and protected spaces for people with disabilities. The platform is built using Base44, a powerful AI-powered application development platform that enables rapid and efficient creation of complex applications while focusing on user needs.

2. Generate an API key with appropriate restrictions
3. Replace the API key in `src/config.js` with your own key
